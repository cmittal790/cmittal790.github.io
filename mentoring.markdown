I provide mentoring services to new entrepreneurs and existing business owners looking to swim in the high tide oceans of both business and technology. 

My 20+ years of experience in starting, operating, and exiting multiple businesses (a few failed) has given me insights, by GOD's humble grace, which i can transfer to you and guide you towards your success.

Most of my mentoring I provide is FREE done in a single 30 mins call to a few calls. You can send me an email with your query and I will try my best to reply back to it with my input. If you like it from there then we can sit on a 30 mins zoom call.

## When do I charge for my mentoring service?

Well, I charge nothing for my mentoring services, till our 1st zoom call, because a commercially driven advice will never be truly inclined towards your success. However, you can provide me a 3% to 5% equity in your startup and then use my experience either as a fractional CTO or as an advisor. Usually, I prefer to sign an agreement with you or your business before sitting on our 2nd 30 mins zoom call. Once we are on an agreement then I will be available to you, as a mentor, just an email away.
