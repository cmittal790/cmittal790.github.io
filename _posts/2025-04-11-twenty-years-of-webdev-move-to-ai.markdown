I found RubyonRails in August or September 2005 while searching for some technical help related to a bug in the web application I was developing in PHP. In October 2005 I developed an MVP, in Rails, for "American Housing Society" basically scaffolding some 200+ pages of their multiple data sources. At that time I guess that was the real strength of Rails to scaffold something really fast. No such feature was available back then either in PHP or Java. And running all scaffolding commands from CLI made it fuhttps://github.com/sublayerapp/monkeyspawn and very fast.

That was 2005 and this is 2025. The era of AI, Generative AI, etc. Today I found an amazing project called [MonkeysPaw](https://github.com/sublayerapp/monkeyspaw) that allows you to generate a full website using prompts. I think AI development is heading towards this direction where GenerativeAI will be the next programming language. Give prompts to your AI model in English (or your native possibly) Language and get a software app or a website designed, developed, built, and deployed for you. I know, there must be tools doing this shit already. It's just that I am not aware of them already.
