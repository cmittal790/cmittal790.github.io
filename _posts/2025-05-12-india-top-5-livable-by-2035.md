There’s no denying the uncomfortable truth — terrorism is once again making headlines in India. From targeted attacks in sensitive regions to disturbing developments across states, the sense of unease is real.

> But here’s the thing: reactive security isn’t enough anymore.

<mark>We need a proactive vision — one that goes beyond dealing with violence and focuses on creating a country that’s fundamentally secure, peaceful, and full of opportunity for every citizen.</mark>

I believe it’s time the Indian government sets a bold and measurable target — to **make India one of the top 5 most livable countries in the world by 2035**.

Now, I know this sounds ambitious, maybe even idealistic. But I’m not talking about some utopian dream.

I’m talking about policy shifts, governance models, and public investments that prioritize quality of life alongside economic growth.

We’ve spent the past two decades chasing GDP numbers, startup counts, and infrastructure milestones. That has value — but it’s not the whole picture.

**What does it mean for a country to be truly livable?**

For me, it’s not just about skyscrapers or fast internet. It’s about safety. Clean air and water. Reliable healthcare and education. **A justice system people trust.** Employment opportunities in every tier of society. Mental health support. Public transport that works. Spaces where families can thrive.

And yes — a deep, daily sense of security where people aren’t looking over their shoulders when they leave home.

> Today, while our economy grows, these basic quality-of-life factors are struggling to keep pace — especially with growing threats like terrorism, cybercrime, and rising communal tension.

**Here’s what I believe the government must start doing now if we want to realistically hit that Top 5 livability target by 2035:**

- Shift national focus from just “growth” to “growth with wellbeing.” GDP is one measure, but we need to track and invest in safety indexes, public health metrics, and quality-of-life standards.
- Modernize internal security without eroding civil liberties. Counter-terror strategies must be intelligence-led, tech-enabled, and community-sensitive — not reactionary and broad-stroked.
- Invest massively in urban and rural resilience. From clean water to digital infrastructure to sustainable mobility, our cities and villages need future-ready systems that prioritize people.
- Make mental and community health a national priority. Fear, stress, and trauma cannot be managed by security forces alone. We need grassroots social interventions.
- Transparent governance with long-term policy continuity. We cannot afford to reset critical social and economic agendas every 5 years. Livability requires consistent planning across decades.

> The good news is — we’re not starting from scratch.

<mark>India has the demographic advantage, a globally aware youth population, and a growing tech backbone.</mark> What we lack is a unified, clear goal that aligns our national energy.

Setting a target like “Top 5 Livable by 2035” may not solve our problems overnight. But it does something powerful — it changes our mindset from crisis management to long-term nation-building. And in times like these, that’s exactly the shift we need.

Let’s move beyond just managing chaos. Let’s start building the kind of India we actually want to live in.
