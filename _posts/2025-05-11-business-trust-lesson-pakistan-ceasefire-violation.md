Recently, Pakistan violated the ceasefire agreement once again — and frankly, I wasn’t surprised. We’ve seen this pattern before: sign a peace deal, make a few nice statements for the global press, and then quietly go back to the old playbook when no one’s looking.

And while I’m not a diplomat or a military strategist, this situation reminded me of something very real and personal from my business life.

A few years ago, I entered into a partnership that seemed rock solid on paper. We aligned on vision, roles, and even future plans. The early meetings felt like everything was falling into place. There were smiles, handshakes, and big promises.

But within a few weeks, the cracks started showing.

Deadlines slipped. Communication dried up. Excuses became frequent. Still, I held on, convincing myself that it would all work out. After all, we had agreed. We had committed. They said the right things.

But when the pressure hit, they bailed — leaving me to clean up the mess, both financially and reputationally.

And that’s when the parallel hit me: just like Pakistan’s repeated ceasefire violations, people and partners can say one thing and do another. Words are easy. What matters is consistency in action.

In business, too many of us fall into the “benefit of the doubt” trap. We want to believe in good intentions. We assume people mean well because they talk well. But business — like national security — needs more than hope. It needs structure, clarity, and earned trust.

Here’s what I learned the hard way:

- **Don’t trust the handshake — trust the track record.**
  Promises don’t mean much if they’re not backed by behavior. Look at how people show up over time, especially under stress.

- **Set boundaries, even with partners.**
  Whether it’s in contracts or daily responsibilities, clarity protects everyone. Don't be afraid to hold people accountable early — it saves pain later.

- **Being cautious isn’t being negative. It’s being responsible.**
  It’s not your job to assume the best. It’s your job to protect what you're building.

India has learned this lesson the hard way, repeatedly — and so have many of us in our businesses.

If someone shows you who they are through their actions, believe them — the first time.

Blind trust is a liability. Earned trust is an asset.

And whether we’re running a business or a nation, the cost of getting it wrong can be high.
